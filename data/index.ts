I had a cavity filled, and Dr. Shawon was very gentle and efficient. My only minor complaint is that there was a bit of a wait before my appointment, but it was well worth it for the quality of care I received. I will definitely be returning.",

The procedure was virtually painless, and his follow-up care was excellent. The entire team at the clinic is courteous and helpful. I am very satisfied with my experience and will recommend Dr. Shawon to my friends and family.",

He explained everything in a way my son could understand and was very gentle during the examination. My son left the clinic happy and excited for his next visit. The only reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the waiting room could use a few more toys or activities for children. Otherwise, fantastic service!",
